# Ludum Dare 38

## Theme Shortlist
**Dark / Light**
- Kingdom Hearts
- Have a RPG like game where you have to choose to be a "good" or "bad" but in the end it doesn't matter herp derp.
  - Everybody treats me the same, even if you're evilish.
- Puzzle game where you either paint the world in color, or turn the world gray.

**You control the game, not the player**
- System game of some kind; guide the player through a trial/path/course?

**Parallel Dimensions**

**Pausing has Consequences**
- Expend resources when paused
- A game where pausing does not stop resource/health deterioration
- Pausing just pauses time
- A movement-based game where you have to keep moving
- A game that forces/requires you to stop and take a look around you
- Talking simulator
  - Stopping and reading the speech bubbles gives you story, but you lose points
  - Throw in choices to be lolzy

**Keep it Alive**
- Have a game where you have to maintain a balloon in the air.
  - Or with a baby a-la kitten cannon.

**Two Colors**
- Dot Wars 2? 3D?

**Island**
- Puzzle game; play as a god that has to divide up the island to meet some end
  - How to divide up the island for optimal resource usage? #smallworld
- Gerrymandering game?

**A World in the Skies**
- The dogfighting game we all deserve. With air nazis.

**You are Alone**
- A hide and go seek game where you never find anyone.
- Cumquest.

**Inconvenient Superpowers**
- Any genre; any game that has a randomly generated trade off that you have to live with for the whole game.
  - Or you have to pick a super power, but design the game levels such that the super power is inconvenient.

**On / Off**

**Death is only the Beginning**
- Light, skeletal narrative; the player dies at the end, but the message should be that the human gets to keep living afterwards
  - Provide opportunity to reflect
  - Game mechanic around death
  - Rogue-like?

**Start with Nothing**

**One Tool, Many Uses**
- Puzzle game; literally anything
  - Point and click; perhaps even a parody

**Everything has a Cost**
- Simulator
  - Simulator-Simulator; a game that simulates simulator games.

**A Small World: Official Theme**
- A game that's entirely in one place
  - Could have players allude to a larger world that the player never sees.
- Maps?
- Coincidences?
  - Avoid coincidences?
- Re-live past actions to get around puzzles?
- Parody; force the players to do a bunch of useless things only to reveal that they don't mean anything.
- Actually physically large human that accidentally steps on stuff.
- Make this a planet-sized game; protect the planet?
  - Play as the Earth that is fleeing a large planet; you have to travel the galaxy to prepare for a final fight for redemption.
- Microscopic world?
- World generation; goal is to populate that world? Or other goals?
  - Short-term game; worlds that don't last very long but have a lot of different configurations.
- Game about growth; control an entity that grows throughout the game.
  - As the camera zooms out, the play space grows.
- Strategy game about globalized trade.
  - Demonstrates how inter-connected things are
  - Small changes would affect the whole world.
- The game space shrinks
  - You have to protect yourselves.
- Business mogul game
  - Goal is to try and buy up as much of the world's economy.
  - The commodities can be anything.
  - What if the resources were limited.
- Base game is like Terraria
  - But the whole game is limited to the screen
  - Time-limited; after some time, a challenge is presented.
  - Have to prepare yourself for an attack?
- Arena fighting game
  - Gladiatorial combat?
  - What if you're told that after x number kills, you will be freed? Then you find out that they just take you to a larger arena. The cycle continues.
- Termite game
  - Pacman like; your goal is the eat through the tree to freedom.
- RTS
  - But with termites
  - Solve puzzles
  - Squad based
  - Shoe in mouth
- Do not let Kanye make the meme reference that Daniel doesn't know...
- You need to bounce a ball around in a box
  - Use the arrow keys to time the bouncing
  - Or have a game where you have to avoid the ball (you are a person that could be crushed by the ball)

## Constraints
- Limit to dexterity games
- Limit to the official theme
- Centered around a game mechanic; not so story heavy
- Needs a really solid mechanic that lasts a very short-turnaround or some words
- Requires minimal assets

## Idea Shortlist
- A game that's entirely in one place
  - Could have players allude to a larger world that the player never sees.
- Actually physically large human that accidentally steps on stuff.
- Game about growth; control an entity that grows throughout the game.
  - As the camera zooms out, the play space grows.
- The game space shrinks
  - You have to protect yourselves.
  - Could be galactic/planet level protection.
  - Or You need to bounce a ball around in a box
    - Use the arrow keys to time the bouncing
    - Or have a game where you have to avoid the ball (you are a person that could be crushed by the ball)

## Mechanic Shortlist
- Rhythm (GETTIN ARMON REAL GOOD; 20 seconds of dick worth here)
  - Timing
  - Repeating/building patterns?
- Accuracy
  - Point and click/shoot
- Dexterity Platforming
  - Dodge bad things
  - Or hitting/interacting with good things
- AVOID: Hard-Coded
  - Less predictable
- Bouncing a ball off the wall
  - Ball bouncing determines what happens next
  - Or what if you have to launch a ball, bounce it, and then catch it?

## Pretty Solid Mechanic, for now
- Control a ball that is traveling from one side of the screen to the other.
- Goal: Destroy items on the screen?
- Delta: Different balls have different properties?
- Losing: Don't time the collision with the wall.

## Walls & Ripples
- Theme: either focus on shrinking & speeding or we can make the presentation fit the theme.
